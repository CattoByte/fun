Guidelines for the Chen pictures:
Avoid the whole frame, especially if there are (for example) two characters at the edges, as that can not be fitted into 16:9 without one of the characters being abruptly cut.
Don't avoid the whole frame if some context is necessary (refer to honk honk panel 3)
Steps:
	To keep the images crisp, apply a selective gaussian blur ~3 times with these settings:
		Blur radius	50
		Max. delta	0.05
	Manually remove all other things that will not end up in the final picture, as to make the process below work better.
	Use indexed color to limit the colors to 5 (the colors of things like the eyes will change, but that's part of the style I'm going for).
	Fix mistakes in the indexing process manually, will take a long time.
	If the pannel has a character being cut at the left, place the image on the left, if it is on the right, place the image on the right.
	If it is both, find an alternative (refer to #1's example).
	If it is none, do whatever you want.
